  <h4>One of my personal favorites</h4>
  <p>
    The Sigma 18-35 is one of the most versatile lenses you’ll find, Sigma has done a pristine job with this piece of glass and is truly worthy of the “Art” badge they slap on it.  Also, if you are a fan of Youtube, there’s a good chance that your favorite youtubers have this lens in their arsenal.
  </p>
  <p>
    People often wonder, “what lens are those Youtubers using?!”Welp, one of the more famous ones when asked:
  </p>
  <div class="centerimg" style="width:70%">
    <img src="images/mkbhd1835.png" />
  </div>
  <p>Let me tell you why this lens was so ground breaking, for one it is the only normal-zoom you will find with a constant f/1.8 aperture.</p>
  
  <p>This is a huge plus in two main ways, one of them being that with a wider aperture, you are allowing more light into the lens, which means lower ISO’s for better quality images, and faster shutter speeds as well which also helps the quality of your photos due to less chance of vibration or any kind of hand shake being an issue.</p>
  
  <p>Some of you guys may be thinking “but it doesn’t have VR :(”, it’s true that VR on this camera would have been icing on the cake.  Heck VR on any lens would be icing on the cake! But! Even if given the option of VR, some people may not even opt for it because VR is still only for very specific type of people.  I wrote a more in-depth post on why I would rather have a “faster”lens with a lower aperture than a lens with a higher aperture but has VR.  See my post here for why I truly believe that faster aperture will beat out VR any day.</p>

  <p>Back to the topic at hand which is this lens!</p>

  <h4>Optics</h4>
  <p><em>17 Elements in 12 groups, 5 SLD glass elements, 4 aspherical elements...</em> </p>
  <p>I would keep going with the numbers but, during my time in photography, I've rarely seen it matter that much.  Heck, I'd even argue that for the most part, all of those scientific numbers and jargon barely make any difference in what you would actually see in your final image.  If you took an image from a 50mm 1.8 which would cost you $100~ and compare it to an image taken with a $2000~ lens, UNLESS you pixel peep and really dive down into the edges, check out the color fringing.. you will not notice that much if a difference if at all.  The differences for the average photographer is negligible!</p>
  
  <p>If you are a wedding photographer some other type of professional photographer, sure maybe, if someone is paying you $5000 to capture moments that ideally are once in a life time, then yeah you probably want to consider the best of the best.  But for most of us out there who just want to take decent pictures with excellent quality with a professional look, no need to break the bank! </p>

  <p>Pairing this with a Canon T6s, the image quality this delivered was excellent, tack sharp especially around the middle with low amounts of vignetting.</p>

  <h4>Build Quality</h4>
  <p>Let’s talk build quality, this thing is built like a tank!  Compared to the Canon 24-70L II, even with it’s infamous red ring, the Sigma 18-35 would win in a fight, by weight alone.  The zoom ring is extremely smooth! If I had to compare it to the pro grade lenses of Canon or Sigma, the zoom/focus ring on these lenses feel even more professional.  In terms of the type of rubber material they put on this and the ribbed form of the rings, Sigma really got it “just right”.  It's hard to describe but moving across the zoom and focus range is a very satisfying feeling, because it is just so precise.  The weight is almost troublesome if I really had to say, it is pretty heavy and it's length makes it a little bit uncomfortable for prolonged periods of time, if held with one hand.</p>

  <h4>Price:</h4>
  <p>When this lens was first announced I expected it to be ridiculously expensive due to what it was offering. 18-35mm focal length with a constant f/1.8 aperture, this at that point in time was unheard of.  Sigma is the first to do this and is currently the only one offering it.</p>

  <p>For $799, this is not bad at all.  Putting this 18-35 on your crop sensor body is essentially the same as putting a 24-70 f/2.8 on a full frame body, in terms of bokeh and light.  Which is still way better than what you would spend on a full frame lens, which would be around $1800-$2700 depending which one you buy, and that's not including the price of a full frame body, which would be around the same.  </p>

  <h4>Cons</h4>
  <p>The only con I can think of about this lens, which may be a deal breaker for some people... is the viewfinder focus.  When I first bought this lens I actually ended up returning it due to back-focus problems it had when using the viewfinder to focus.  I even purchased the extra $60 Sigma Dock where it allows you to configure the lens via software in terms of focus and firmware to try and see what I can do to help alleviate the issue, but in the end I could not fix it, and ended up returning both the dock and the lens.</p>
  <p><strong>However!</strong> despite the initial lack-luster focus performance, if you are using this with the live-view focus, which I found myself doing about 99% of the time anyway.  Because it has been proven time and again that today's live-view focus is WAY more accurate than what you will get by looking at the viewfinder.  Even when using my traditional Canon or Nikon lenses, I still go with live view focus because of the accuracy, also you can't really beat being able to "see what you get" kind of accuracy.  That's why they call it "live view" right?</p>
  <h4>Field Tests</h4>
  <p>But really lets move on to the good stuff, what is this lens capable of?  I’ve included here some images that I took with this lens, notice that buttery bokeh!</p>
