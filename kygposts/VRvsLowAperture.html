    <h4>
      Vibration Reduction
    </h4>
    <p>
      First of all, what is vibration reduction?  Companies call it different names so you may hear it as Image Stablization if it's Canon(IS), Optical Stablization(OS) if it's Sigma, or Vibration Reduction(VR) if it's Nikon.  Essentially what it is is something that attempts to compensate for any kind of vibration, such as maybe that slight camera movement when you click the shutter button as you take a photo.
    </p>
    <h4>Aperture</h4>
    <p>
      The aperture is the part of your lens that essentially decides how much light it allows to hit the sensor.  It's a little bit counter-intuitive due to the math that goes into the calculation of the f/ number, but what I would just keep in mind is: The lower the f/ number, the bigger that opening is.  A wider aperture brings two very important, and really, wonderful things.  Number 1, with more light hitting the sensor, it means lower ISO, which means less noise, which means a better quality image!  <strong>[Insert Image here of comparison]</strong></p>

    <h4>My opinion?</h4>
    <p>
      I would take a lower aperture over VR any day!  One of the main selling points of VR is that you can shoot at lower shutter speeds, all the way down to 1/40th of a second, and sometimes even 1/30th, and still maintain a "steady" shot.  This is great if you are taking pictures of objects, buildings, stars, or any other subject that has no movement.  But what if you are taking a picture of an animal? or a person?  It doesn't matter if your shooting it at 1/30th of a second and have a "steady" image, what you'll notice is that the shot you took at 1/30s, the non-moving objects are perfectly fine but the person or animal with slight movement are slightly blurry.
    </p>

    <h5><em>Now why is this?</em></h5>
    <p>Well if you think about it, if you want to "freeze" motion you usually choose a really high shutter speed so that you don't have any blurry parts to your image due to motion.  The same thing applies here, usually the lower shutter speed i go is around 1/60th of a second.  This is because most of the pictures I take usually involve people being in the shot, and usually there will always be SOME slight movement because you will never be able to tell people to stay <em>perfectly</em> still.</p>

    <h4>"Letting more light into the sensor"</h4>
    <p>Two ways of doing this is either shooting at a wider aperture, or shooting at a lower shutter speed.  Obvious right?  Open the shutter for longer, more light!  Wider aperture, bigger hole for light to come through, more light!  But the effects that come from these two are really different.  A wider aperture would allow you more light while maintaining a higher shutter speed, which in turn doesn't make you sacrifice any potential blur from subject movement.I would much rather have a higher aperture because I usually like optimizing my low light performance, without sacrificing my shutter speed.  If I lower my shutter speed down to 1/30s or lower, I tend to get way too much blur on my actual subjects due to their inherent movements.</p>

    <h4>Is there ever a good time for VR?</h4>
    <p>Absolutely!  The time when VR really shines is when used with Telephoto lenses, if you're using a telephoto lens shooting at 200mm, you may notice that it is way harder to hold that camera still.  Not only due to the bigger size of your lens adding that extra weight, but in general, if you are at 200mm or around that, any slight movement moves the image you see in the viewfinder pretty significantly.  This is where usually you would have to move your shutter speed up to 1/160th of a second or maybe even 1/200th of a second to compensate and get that clear and crisp image.  But at that point you are sarificing way too much light, in this case, the VR would allow you to go down to maybe around 1/80th-ish of a second</p>
    <p>So for me pllersonally, I would only use VR, to help me maintain my 1/60th of a second rule, otherwise I really would prefer not to go below that shutter speed, because it sacrifices too much quality in my image.</p>
